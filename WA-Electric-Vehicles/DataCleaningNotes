# Data Cleaning
Open in Excel (10AM):
Change Col A from ‘VIN (1-10)’ to ‘VIN’
Check for & change blank cells
-	Legislative district blanks – from out of WA state -> 0
-	2020 Census track -> null
-	Electric utility -> null
-	Vehicle location -> null

Open MySQL Workbench:
-	Check server connection
-	Create schema “electric_vehicle”
-	Create table w/ import wizard from csv “wa_ev”

## Ideas for exploration:
--	Are certain EV types more dominant in the market?
--	Do EV brands tend to partner with certain electric utility companies?
--	Which makes and models are the most popular in Washington?
--	How are electric vehicles distributed across different regions in Washington?

## Are certain EV types more dominant in the market?
### What EV types are in the data set?

```
SELECT DISTINCT `Electric Vehicle Type` FROM electric_vehicle.wa_ev;
```

o	Battery Electric Vehicle
o	Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle

-	Count of VIN by EV type

```
SELECT `Electric Vehicle Type`, COUNT(VIN) AS VIN_Count
FROM electric_vehicle.wa_ev
GROUP BY `Electric Vehicle Type`
ORDER BY VIN_Count DESC;  
```

--Battery Electric Vehicle BEV = 98107, Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle PHEV = 28115

## Which makes and models are the most popular in Washington?

```
SELECT Make, Model, COUNT(VIN) AS VIN_Count
FROM wa_ev
GROUP BY Make, Model
ORDER BY VIN_Count DESC;
```

Export (save) (new folder) “Results”  / MostPopular

## Do EV brands tend to partner with certain electric utility companies?
### What companies are there?

```
SELECT DISTINCT `Electric Utility` FROM wa_ev
```

### Group all 'Bonneville Power Administration's as BPA, +2 more

```
SELECT 
	CASE
		WHEN `Electric Utility` LIKE 'BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION%' THEN 'BPA'
        WHEN `Electric Utility` LIKE '%puget sound energy%' THEN 'Puget Sound Energy'
		WHEN `Electric Utility` LIKE '%pud%' THEN 'PUD'
        ELSE `Electric Utility`
	END AS `Modified Electric Utility`,
    COUNT(*) AS `Count`
FROM 
	electric_vehicle.wa_ev
GROUP BY 
	`Modified Electric Utility`
ORDER BY 
	`Count` DESC;
```

### Now to put in order with make and model
### Tesla S & Y most frequent across all utilities 
## Most vehicles per county/city/zip code

```
SELECT
	County,
    COUNT(VIN) AS vehicle_count
FROM
	electric_vehicle.wa_ev
GROUP BY
	County
ORDER BY
	vehicle_count DESC;
```

Save as “CountyCount” under “Portfolio Projects” “EV_WA” “Results”
Cont. for CityCount and ZipCount

# Data Visualization
## Open Tableau Public for visuals
Plan for Dashboard Elements: Types (Pie), Popular (Bar), Locations (Map)
-	Change Popular to Bubble Graph
Font: Benton Sans
Place all three charts on a dashboard.

### Details:
Coolors.co to find a usable color palette.
Google Tesla and other EV companies to target a similar font.
Save As to Tableau Public EV-Dashboard

# Insights
## In Washington…
### 1.	BEV dominate the market at 78%
	When building charging stations around a business, consider inclusive use of charging stations: Level 1 & 2 Charging Stations accept all cars, but Level 3 may not*
### 2.	3 out of 4 Top selling EV brands is Tesla
	Consider carrying Tesla accessories
### 3.	Weak correlation between utility companies and vehicle companies
### 4.	EVs are more likely to travel in cities
	Target marketing to Seattle, Olympia, Tacoma
