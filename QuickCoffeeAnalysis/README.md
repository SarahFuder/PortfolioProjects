**Results**
1.	For all three locations, sales are highest between the hours of 7AM and 10AM with a steep drop in sales after 6PM.
•	Business Insight --> Close the shops at 6PM since sales decrease at that time on a routine basis to increase overall profitability.
2.	Monday and Thursday are busy days for all three locations. Likely due to people buying coffee as a pick-me-up to start their week or as a mid-week treat.
•	Business Insight --> Consider handing out coupons on Monday and Thursday to increase sales for the rest of the week. Alternatively, sponsor events on the other days to draw in more traffic, such as open mic events.
3.	Packaged chocolate is the least selling product category in all three locations.
•	Business Insight --> If the cost of producing packaged chocolate is high, consider removing this product from the menu to increase overall profitability.
4.	Most revenue comes from Brewed Chai Tea and Barista Espresso.
•	Business Insight --> Introduce premium or seasonal choices to leverage customer loyalty, such as a “Dirty Chai Latte” or “Lavender Espresso Latte.”
